# Turn-Based-Combat-LOL
This is a C# code I write entirely on Visual Studio Code. It's about turn-based combat and it was text-based, so it will be easy. This project was actually done so u can try it right now, but if u wish to simplify the code, I'll allow it.
There might be some bugs, thx if u want to fix it

Bugs have been FIXED!! After 2 years of forgetting the existence of this project. Oh yea make sure u have .NET 5.0 installed.

...or the recent version of .NET (.NET 6.0 at the time), with a little workaround.
